# durexforth-extras
Some mostly untested words for durexforth, use with caution. 
These words will evolve on time, hopefully one day reach usable state.

For now on offer  
- Couple random number generators, Sid Chip and LSFR (forth and asm)
- Cordic trigonometry (forth words for sin and cos)
- 6502 disassembler (forth)

Durexforth is a new, mostly 2012 standard Forth for Commorore 64.
