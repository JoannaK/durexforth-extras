A cordic routine found on net. Original email headers kept, not sure about licences. Written in high level Forth, 
no optimizations for speed. 

Most of file is intact. I have added some words to make it work with durexforth (V3 .crt) and for testing. 
It seems to work ok, gives nice results. Spreadsheet file has some comparision info, looks like routines
give 3 desimals accurately and 4th has max +-2 deviation.
